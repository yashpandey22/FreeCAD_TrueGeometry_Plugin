# FreeCAD_TrueGeometry_Plugin

## TrueGeometry
TrueGeometry.com is in its "alpha"  version. It is cloud platform for storage of various open source 3D file formats. As experimental feature it has ways to reverse engineers 3D models, search for similar components and with usage of machine learning it can transform assemblies into each other with a click of mouse. Some more futuristic features include motion transfer  for animation and VR use cases.

## FreeCAD TrueGeometry Plugin
### Feature 1:
  The plugin provides facility to upload your FreeCAD drawings directly to www.TrueGeometry.com cloud.
### Feature 2:
  The plugin provides facility to directly download your drawings from www.TrueGeometry.com cloud to FreeCAD application.
### Feature 3:
  The plugin provides facility to download crossover of two drawings created at www.TrueGeometry.com cloud to FreeCAD application.
* Crossover analyses parts of first model and attempts to create the second model. This module, basically explorers the feasibility of using parts of a geometry in another geometry as per their simmilarity index.
